ABOUT THE USE OF MASS EFFECT INFORMATION

Mass Effect is probably copyrighted/trademarked by BioWare/Electronic Arts.
This program does not intend to challenge the copyright/trademark, or infringe
on it.

To be clear: Everything "Mass Effect", implicitly or explicitly, is owned by
BioWare/Electronic Arts.

Some of the maps reproduce maps from the Mass Effect games, and sometimes extend
them. Again, this is not intended as a challenge or infringement.

This is a fan creation, free of charge, usable by anyone willing to enjoy the
Mass Effect universe beyond the video games.
